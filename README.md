# Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Simple Commands

```npm start``` - run development server
```npm i``` - install dependencies

# Dallies ( or things to do every day )
## Before You Start the day
Do these things before you start writing code
```git pull``` - pull down changes made by either you or your partner the previous day;  resolve any conflicts between your current code and any pulls, but there should be non intially as long as your following the instructions

```git merge dev``` - pull down any new things that I changed; there maybe conflicts here;  message/talk to me if there are any

## During the Day
These things should be happening as you write code

```git commit -m <A message>;  git push``` - after any major update you think works, commit it

```npm start``` - make sure you're running the development server as you're working on the code


## At the end of the day
Do this before you go home
```git commit -m `End of Day Commit`; git push``` - Do this command exactly
